Professor Strang's Related Courses on OCW
-----------------------------------------

Professor Strang's foundational course [_18.06 Linear Algebra_](/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010) has long been one of the most popular courses on OCW. It has received more than 10 million visits since its first publication in 2002. Professor Strang also has a website dedicated to his {{% resource_link "f73b97e0-7875-4703-afb6-c3dbc48d95d2" "linear algebra teaching" %}}.

A new version of this classic Linear Algebra course was released in 2011 in the innovative OCW Scholar format designed for independent learners. _[18.06SC Linear Algebra](/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011)_ includes 35 lecture videos and 36 short (and highly-praised) problem-solving help videos by teaching assistants.

Professor Strang has continued to offer new insights into key mathematics subjects. In 2014, he published the new textbook _{{% resource_link "b073ebbb-20a4-42ec-ba0f-b72417287bc8" "Differential Equations and Linear Algebra" %}}_. In 2016, that textbook was developed into a series of 55 short videos supported by MathWorks, with parallel videos about numerical solutions by Dr. Cleve Moler, the creator of MATLAB®. The textbook and video lectures help students in a basic ordinary differential equations course. This new series, [_Learn Differential Equations: Up Close with Gilbert Strang and Cleve Moler_](/courses/res-18-009-learn-differential-equations-up-close-with-gilbert-strang-and-cleve-moler-fall-2015), is also available on the {{% resource_link "89aaa1a1-8e92-4bf5-a893-fd2b7a1c9d9b" "MathWorks website" %}}.

Professor Strang's latest course on the topic is _[A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra](/courses/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020)_. These six brief videos contain ideas and suggestions from Professor Strang about the recommended order of topics in teaching and learning linear algebra. The first topic is called _A New Way to Start Linear Algebra_. That leads to _The Column Space of a Matrix_. The remaining videos outline very briefly the full course: _The Big Picture of Linear Algebra_; _Orthogonal Vectors_; _Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors_; and _Singular Values & Singular Vectors_.

[_ZoomNotes for Linear Algebra_ (PDF)](/courses/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/resources/zoomnotes_18-010). Professor Strang created these notes in 2020 and 2021 when many MIT classes were moved online (using Zoom) due to the {{% resource_link "fb0f53da-53de-4e29-936c-a46b4567915a" "COVID-19 Pandemic" %}}. He hopes that faculty who are planning a linear algebra course and students who are reading for themselves will see these notes.

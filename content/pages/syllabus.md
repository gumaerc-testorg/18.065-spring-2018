Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[_18.06 Linear Algebra_](/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011)

Description
-----------

Linear algebra concepts are key for understanding and creating machine learning algorithms, especially as applied to deep learning and neural networks. This course reviews linear algebra with applications to probability and statistics and optimization–and above all a full explanation of deep learning.
